# Task 1
It still gives my some incorrect results. I am working on it. Correct solution and task description soon.

# Task 2
Write a method calculating damage done by a spell of the famous polish wizard.  
Eg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkeVYHJ6AG8 - 'fejejeeaindaiyaiai'

Spell consists of subspells. Each subspell add points of damage respectively:  
'fe' - 1  
'je' - 2  
'jee' - 3  
'ain'- 3  
'dai'- 5  
'ne' - 2  
'ai'- 2  

Spell start with 'fe' and end with 'ai'. Spell body can have subspells or other letters, but every single letter (not in a subspell) decrease damage of spell by 1 point. 'fe' can occur only once and 'ai' always end the spell. If you can use different sets of subspells in spell, choose the one with the biggest damage (in example fedaineai: fe-dai-ne-ai: 2+5+2+2, not fe-d-ain-e-ai 2-1+3-1+2).

Method should return 0 if damage is negative or if spell is incorrect.

Correct spells:  
'xxxxxfejejeeaindaiyaiaixxxxxx' (fe-je-jee-ain-ai-ai-ai)  
'jejefeai' (fe-ai)  

Incorrect spells:  
'jejeai' (doesn't start with 'fe')  
'dadsafeokokok' (doesn't end with 'ai')  
'aioooofe'

i.e.  
damage('feeai') == 2  
damage('feaineain') == 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7 (fe-ai-ne-ai) - not (fe-ain-ai) because 1+3+2 = 6  
damage('jee') == 0  
damage('fefefefefeaiaiaiaiai') == 0 (more than one 'fe')  
damage(fdafafeajain) == 1 (fe-ai) 3 - 2 (because 'aj')  
damage('fexxxxxxxxxxai') == 0 (3-10 = -7 < 0)  

Solution should contain damage method inside.  

def damage(spell):  
"""  
Function calculating damage  
:param str spell: string with spell  
:rtype: int  
:return: points of damage  
"""  
pass
